Chapter 1
第一章
“Never before so beautiful, n’er a blue so heavenly, n’er the clouds so gossamer, n’er the air so sweet nor my senses so intoxicated, so overwhelmed. Earth, the only place we will call home, no matter where we go or how far we travel. Permit harm to befall our planet? 
Never.” 
“从未有一个地方如此美丽，那里的天空如此湛蓝，那里的云朵如此缥缈，那里的空气如此清新，让我如此陶醉，激动不已。地球，我们唯一称其为家的地方。不管我们去向何方也无论我们走得多远，难道会允许她受到伤害吗？
绝不！”

——伊莲•萨顿 博士
摘自Winterblossom（冬日繁花）号航行日志

John Friedman relaxed into the cockpit gravity seat and watched the unwavering stars, thinking. With the propulsion system switched off, only slight movement of the closer solar bodies hinted at the record-shattering speed of the heavy salvage vessel racing across the empty distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars. 
John Friedman（约翰•弗里德曼）放松的靠在座舱重力椅上，看着窗外不会闪烁的星空思考着。随着推进系统的关闭，只有近日天体的微小移动显示出重型救捞船正义破纪录的速度在木星和火星轨道之间穿行。

Without stirring, Friedman stole a side-long glance at his companion in the second seat. Ayse McCallum lay back in the same relaxed position, also lost in thought, her dark eyes staring into infinity. 
没有转过头去，Friedman斜眼偷瞟了一眼坐在副驾驶位置上的同伴。Ayse McCallum（艾谢•麦卡勒姆）也同样斜靠在坐椅里陷入了深思，深色的双眸盯着无尽的星空。

The dying flash of a micro-meteorite impacting on the shields snapped his attention back to the stars and his mind returned to the conundrum invoked by their velocity. 
一颗小陨石撞击护盾产生的火花将他的注意力拉回到星空，脑海中又开始思考起由他们的高速所产生的问题。

The Einstein Twin Paradox. 
爱因斯坦双生子佯谬。

He knew the theory, but the fact that this journey of nine days would be significantly longer from the reference-point of their slower-travelling colleagues aboard the Eldridge was, and he could think of no better scientific term, weird. 
他知道这个理论，但现实是，与搭乘Eldridge（埃尔德里奇）号以较慢速度穿行的对照组同事相比，他们这趟历时九天的旅程时间上要更长一些。对此，他找不到更好的科学解释了，真诡异。

A flashing indicator on the comm system pulled him back into focus. 
通讯系统一盏闪烁的指示灯打断了他的思路。

"Rii-4, come in. Come in, over." 
“Rii-4号，听到请回答，听到请回答，完毕。”

It was Joseph Schwartz from Mission Control aboard the Eldridge, his voice distorted by a slight signal echo. Reception was still slightly out of phase, despite the new software filters. 
那是搭乘Eldridge号的Joseph Schwart（约瑟夫•施瓦茨）从命令控制中心发出的呼叫，他的声音因为信号反射而有点失真。尽管装载了新的滤波器软件，接收还是有些不同相。

"Hi there Joe, Rii-4 receiving, over," he replied, cutting across Ayse, who was just about to respond. With a shrug of her shoulders and an apologetic smile she returned her attention to her panels. 
“你好，Joe（约瑟夫的昵称，译者注），Rii-4收到，完毕”，他回答道，抢在正准备回答的Ayse之前。她带着抱有歉意的微笑耸耸肩膀，回到她负责的仪表台。

After a twelve second distance delay the reply came in. 
十二秒的延迟之后，收到了回复。

"Okay, Rii-4, telemetry analysis complete. Your mass, vector and speed have been calculated to a few dozen decimal points. We can guide you to your baby blindfolded and we’ve computed down to the last joule how much energy will be required for deceleration. It’s not a small amount either John. Data upload complete. Eldridge over and out." 
“好的，Rii-4，遥测分析完毕。你们的质量、航线和速度已计算到小数点后几十位，就算你们闭着眼睛飞，我们也可以给你们导航。我们还精确计算了减速需要多少能量，这可不是个小数目啊，John。数据上传完毕，Eldridge通话结束，完毕。”

"Understood, Eldridge." 
“明白，Eldridge。”

Friedman stifled a flippant comment that Schwartz would certainly not understand, realising it was the wrong moment. 
Friedman本想说Schwartz不明白状况，但很快意识到现在不是说这话的时候。

“Rii-4, out.” 
“Rii-4，完毕。”

Ayse was already studying the new flight-path projected onto the HUD. 
Ayse已开始着手研究投射到HUD（平视显示器）上的新飞行路径。

The course of the Rii-4 and the target were each represented by two long straight lines, a coloured triangle delineating each vessel. The courses were converging, now only a few thousand kilometres apart. They would reach the Intercept Point within hours, assuming they had sufficient energy to match speeds. 
Rii-4和目标的航线分别由两条长长的直线标记，彩色的三角代表各自飞船。航线正在交汇，目前只相距几千公里。假设有满足航速的充足能量，他们几个小时内就能到达拦截点。

She did not need a computer to tell her it was going to be very close. 
不用电脑她也知道已经很接近了。

"Look at the mass and dimensions, John," she said, indicating the tiny digits affixed to the red triangular target designator, her stomach twisting as she absorbed the implications. 
“看它的质量和体积，John，”她指着代表目标的红色三角旁的数字说道，好像意识到了什么一样感到一阵胆寒。

Friedman nodded slowly.
Friedman缓缓地点了点头。 

"I see them, I wish we had a visual." 
“我看到了，真希望可以看到图像。”

Ayse covered her face with her hands and took a deep breath. 
Ayse双手捂着脸深吸了一口气。

"It’s a space ship, John, and not one of ours." 
“是一艘飞船，John，不是我们的。”

"That’s not news, Ayse. Keep focused." 
“这部新鲜，Ayse，集中精力。”

She nodded and cleared the HUD with a slow wave of her hand. 
她点点头，然后缓慢的挥动手臂清除HUD。

She had not mentioned her fears to anyone during the weeks of training or the extensive mission briefing, silenced by the trauma inflicted on humanity and passed down through the generations. 
代代相传的那次对人类毁灭性打击的创伤使她保持沉默，从未在训练的几周内或者听取全面任务简报过程中显露出她的那份恐惧。

Some thoughts were just too terrifying. 
一些想法太过可怕。

The last hours before contact passed slowly, the computer implementing the course corrections and retro burns needed to match course and velocity with the Unknown.  
联系前的几个小时显得格外漫长，电脑进行航线的修正工作并控制点燃制动火箭的时机以匹配不明飞船的航线和速度。

Ayse and John watched the energy reserves fall in silence. Everything had been said, what facts there were, they knew. 
Ayse和John默默注视着备用能量陷入了沉默。该说的都说过了，他们很清楚将要面对什么。

Eleven months previously, automated observatories on several asteroids on the outskirts of the solar system detected a massive disruption of the space-time continuum, accompanied by a hard radiation burst emanating from a single light source. 
十一个月以前，太阳系外为一些小行星上的自动观测站监测到了对时空连续性的强大干扰，伴随着从单一光源爆发出的强烈辐射。

The Oort Cloud, the band beyond the planets where comets swarm like mosquitoes, had a new visitor. 
行星带外遍布蚊群般彗星的奥尔特星云有了一个新访客。

The position was easily triangulated and a course extrapolated. Mass Detectors, quietly diverted from astronomical duties, tracked the path of the unidentified contact as it plunged in through the solar system from deep space. 
人们很简单的就标记出其坐标并推测出其航线。当他从深空闯入太阳系时，出于天文目地秘密发射的质量探测器飞向了该不明物体。

Unnoticed by commercial space stations, the object was on an intercept course with the QUASI Experimental Installation, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This fact alone was enough to cause significant alarm in government and military circles. 
该物体的航线正好与位于火星和木星轨道之间的QUASI实验站交汇。这一情况没有引起商业太空站的注意，但足够引起政界和军方的警惕。

The UFO, almost certainly an alien space ship, posed a potential threat and was not responding to hails. 
这个不明飞行物，几乎可以肯定是一艘外星飞船，构成了潜在的威胁而且并不回应任何呼叫。

Within weeks it increased velocity and continued accelerating. 
数周内它增加了航速并且持续加速。

A diplomatic mission was dispatched but what appeared to be a major explosion brought the acceleration to a halt. Orbital telescopes indicated several pieces had broken off from the main body, which was now tumbling in space, rotating along several axes but still on course for the QUASI Station. 
紧急派遣的一项外交使命，其实更像一次大爆破行动，终止了该物体的加速。轨道太空望远镜观测到数个爆炸产生的碎片围绕旋转轴在太空中不停翻滚，不过航向仍朝着QUASI太空站。

The mission of the crew of Rii-4 was simple. Slow the UFO down and salvage what you can. 
Rii-4号船员的任务很简单，让这个不明飞行物减速并尽量进行打捞。

Simple but for several unknowns: 
简单却存在疑问：

Would the alien ship permit salvage attempts? 
外星飞船会允许进行打捞吗？

Was salvage possible at all? 
有可能进行打捞吗？

Was it crewed? Were there any survivors? If so, would the aliens be friendly or hostile? 
该飞船上有船员吗？有幸存者吗？如果有，外星人是友好的还是敌对的？

Or was it something completely different? 
又或者完全不是人们所想象的那样？

Their orders were deceptively simple. 
他们的命令看起来很简单。

Stage One - observe and analyse from a safe distance, transmit a live data-feed to the "Eldridge". Only approach and attempt salvage if everything looked safe.
第一阶段——从安全距离进行观察和分析，将数据实时传送给Eldridge号。在确保安全的情况下进行打捞工作。

Stage Two - As the salvage vessel neared the IP the intruder could barely be seen with the naked eye. The matt hull swallowed the pallid light of distant Sol, its presence hinted at by the occlusion of stars. 
第二阶段——当救捞船接近拦截点，应该可以用肉眼观察到入侵者。亚光的船体吞没了来自遥远太阳系的微弱光线，只有遮住星星的时候才会发觉它的存在。

Only in the last few klicks, while John concentrated on the final, manual course adjustments, slowing the Rii-4 to 50 kph relative, could Ayse make out any detail, even with vision enhancers at maximum. 
即使将视野增效器调到最大，也只有当John在最后几公里集中精力人工调整航线将Rii-4号减速到相对速度每小时50时，Ayse才有所发现。

"Looks like they’ve suffered a catastrophic failure." John blinked and tried to focus on the brightened-up image on the main view-screen. The sensors were registering weak energy signatures. 
“看上去他们经历了一场惨败。”John眨了一下眼，然后专注于主显示屏上逐渐变亮的影像。传感器显示出微弱的能量信号。

“Active emergency systems?” 
“要启动应急系统吗？”

“Possibly,” Ayse murmured. “The shape, you know, it could be a shuttle." She paused and focused the scan. 
“好吧，”Ayse嘟囔道。“这外形，你知道，可能是一艘穿梭机。”

"Hey, check this John. Looks like something is missing back there." 
“喂，看看这个，John。看上去它背后差了点什么。”

The UFO was close enough now to reveal a compact aero-dynamic design. A barely visible shadow, extruding centrally from the main body may have been an aerofoil, indicating an atmospheric capability. 
不明飞行物现在已经非常接近了，可以分辨出其空气动力学外形。几乎可以看出从其中部伸展出来的机翼的影子，表明它适应在大气环境下飞行。

This was confirmed as the unknown craft rotated slowly, revealing a jagged edge stump where a second wing could have been. 
当不明飞船缓慢翻转过来，露出另外一边残缺的机翼的时候，这一点得到了确认。

"What in hell is an atmospheric shuttle doing in deep space?" 
“到底一艘在大气中飞行的穿梭机跑到深空来做什么？”

Ayse wondered. 
Ayse困惑了。

She could think of no explanation. 
她想不出任何解释。

As if reading her mind, John looked at her. 
就像能读懂她的心思一样，John看着她。

"This doesn’t really make any sense, does it?"
“这完全没道理，对吧？”

Ayse shook her head vigorously. 
Ayse坚定地摇摇头。

"That thing is atmosphere-capable, or was anyway. So what’s it doing here and how did it get here in the first place?" 
“无论如何，那东西应该呆在大气层内。那它在太空做什么，当初又是怎么进入太空的？”

"No idea,” Freidman replied. “It’s disabled now." 
“不清楚，”Freidman回答道。“现在它也没用了。”

As the UFO tumbled the stern came into view, unveiling more destruction. 
当UFO的船尾转入眼帘的时候，呈现出更多的毁坏部分。

The propulsion section was completely destroyed. Close up scans of the shattered stern showed melted material on the inner chamber, drops of a dark, metallic alloy, frozen in the moment of disaster, protruded like stalactites into the freezing vacuum. 
动力部分已经彻底被摧毁。对损坏的船尾的特写扫描显示出漆黑的船舱中在灾难发生的瞬间被真空冷冻成石钟乳一样融化了的合金。

The hull itself looked like it had both melted and fractured in places, like a plastic plate placed on a hot stove and then plunged into cold water. Apart from the jagged edges of the torn wing stump there were no remaining straight edges, giving the ship a disturbingly organic look, as if it were alive. 
船身有些地方看起来既有融化又有撕裂的痕迹，就像放在炙热电炉上的塑料盘被猛然抛进冰冷的水中。除了锯齿状被撕裂的残存机翼外，找不到一处平直的边缘。这使得飞船呈现出一种令人不安的生物景象，就好像它是活物一样。

It was an unsettling thought and one John discarded with an involuntary shudder and a joke. 
这种令人惶恐的想法让John不禁打了一个冷颤，也让他想起一个笑话。

"As Kyle would probably say, get a load of that flying turd!" 
“要是Kyle（凯尔）可能会说，小心那块鸟粪！”

Ayse laughed, it sounded forced. 
Ayse笑了笑，笑得很勉强。

"Yes, probably." 
“是的，有可能。”

"What do you think?" John asked after a short while. 
“你觉得呢？”过了一会儿John问道。

Her answer was short, 
她的回答很简短，

"Stage Two," but she did ask for his opinion. 
“第二阶段，”但她确实征求过他的意见了。

The Eldridge reluctantly agreed and with delicate bursts of the lateral thrusters John moved the Rii-4 closer to the gyrating alien ship and held steady at 10 meters. 
在勉强取得了Eldridge号的同意后John精确的开关侧向推进器，控制Rii-4号接近旋转中的外星飞船并稳定的保持在10米间距范围。

Little more detail appeared, there simply wasn’t enough light this deep into the solar system and Ayse was reluctant to activate the spots in case that was taken as a hostile act. But there were no signs of survivors and they did, after all, intend to halt its rotation with an electro-magnetic field prior to salvage. 
由于远离太阳系光线不足难以看清更多的细节，Ayse极不情愿的打开聚光灯以防突发的敌对行动。但却没有发现幸存者的迹象，毕竟，他们确实试图在打捞之前使用电磁场阻止飞船继续旋转。

That would hardly pass un-noticed, lights or no lights. 
不管有没有灯光，这么做都很难不被发现。

John concurred with her reasoning. Setting the exterior spots to low intensity she illuminated the alien ship and emboldened by the lack of reaction she increased the brightness until for the first time they could see the ship in detail. 
John同意她的观点。他调暗外部聚光灯并打到外星飞船上，它毫无反应，这促使她逐渐调亮灯光直到他们首次可以仔细查看该飞船。

It looked surprisingly small, no more than 20 meters in length, give or take a few lost in the accident. The low albedo black alloy covered about two thirds of the hull, from the bow back to what may have been the section housing the destroyed propulsion system and possibly, John hypothesized, a magnetic M/AM storage tank, or an equivalent. 
它看起来出奇的小，除去事故中失去的部分，长度不超过20米。低反照率的黑色合金覆盖了约三分之二的船体，从船头到看起来像被摧毁的推进系统的外罩，John推测着，也可能是物质/反物质储存舱，或类似的什么。

He quickly discarded that idea. A Matter/Anti-matter accident would have vapourised the ship in an explosion visible from Earth, in daylight. 
他很快打消了这一念头。要是物质/反物质事故的话，就算在大白天也可以从地球观看到，而且飞船早就应该在爆炸时被气化了。

No, whatever destroyed this ship was far less destructive. 
不对，无论什么摧毁了飞船，其破坏力都应该小得多。

Ayse continued to study the object, gripped by the feeling that something was wrong and unable to put words to her fear. 
Ayse接着研究，总觉得有什么不对劲，而且有一种无以言表的恐惧萦绕心头。

A craft of a type normally used for orbital transport found in deep space, travelling at near light speed? 
深空中发现通常用于轨道运输的飞船，而且以接近光速飞行？

For a moment her thoughts went back to Earth and the entrancing vision of the blue planet from space. It was a sight she’d witnessed on a hundred shuttle trips and every time yearned for more. 
一时间她的思绪回到了地球，那颗太空中令人神魂颠倒的蓝色星球。那是在太空穿梭旅程中见过上百次的景象，而每次都看不够。

"John ..." she started, her tongue suddenly large in her mouth. 
“John...”她突然站起身来，说话都结巴起来。

"John, there aren’t any viewports or windows, not even a cockpit!" 
“John，没有任何瞭望窗或者舷窗，甚至没有座舱！”

Friedman frowned and shrugged his shoulders. 
Friedman皱起眉头耸了耸肩。

"You’re right but I’m not sure what you’re driving ... holy shit!" 
“你是对的，但我还不确定你的意思... ...我的天啊！”

Ayse sat rooted in fear, a wave of horror flooding her body as the under-side of the rotating ship tumbled into view, revealing a large symbol emblazoned onto the light-swallowing alloy. 
当飞船下部转入眼帘的时候，露出一个镶嵌在亚光合金上的巨大标志。Ayse瘫坐在一边，一阵恐惧感席卷全身。

A simple drawing, a few distinct lines. Almost child-like. 
那是由几条近乎稚气而又分明的线条组成的图案。

The symbol of the Terraformer Fleet. 
Terraformer舰队的标志。

John instantly activated the shields and fought the temptation to start the engines of the Rii-4 and back off. 
John立即开启了护盾并启动Rii-4号的引擎迅速后退。

No need to panic, the possibility of an encounter with the most feared enemy of humanity had been touched on in training. 
没必要恐慌，遭遇人类最可怕敌人的可能性在训练中已经提到过。

Briefly. 
简要提过。

Worst-case scenarios - no-one actually expected them to happen. 
那也只是最坏的情况，没人想到真的发生了。

Taking a deep breath he made an effort to relax and assess the situation. Okay, it may be a Terraformer ship but it was severely damaged and appeared non-functional. 
他做了个深呼吸努力镇定下来，然后开始评估状况。好吧，那也许是一艘Terraformer飞船，但它已经严重损坏而且看起来已无法操作。

It was crucial that they remained with the object and finished the mission as planned. 
至关重要的是他们要和这艘飞船呆在一起并按计划完成任务。

Now more than ever. 
现在比以往任何时候都更需要这么做。

At all costs they needed to find out where the ship had come from, if it actually was capable of inter-stellar travel without jump-gates, and, most importantly, what it was up to. 
他们必须不计代价的查出该飞船来自何方，以及它是否真能无需传送门就能进行星际旅行，还有最重要的，他的目的地是哪里。

Worst case scenario? A scout for a huge fleet of the Terraformers coming to finish off what they started five centuries ago and extinguish humanity for good.
最坏的情况？这是一艘来自庞大Terraformer舰队的侦察机，为了完成他们五百年前就开始做的事情，永久性的消灭人类。

"It is disabled, isn't it?" Ayse asked, seeking re-assurance. John did not answer, understanding her fear. It was a fear whose roots were deep. 
“它已经报废了，对吗？”Ayse问道，想求得确认。John没有回答，他能理解她的恐惧，那是一种根深蒂固的恐惧。

Simultaneously they sealed their helmets and fought fear with outward calm. Her voice firm and in control as she briefed the Eldridge, John, by-the-book methodical as he prepared the electromagnetic impulse decelerator. 
与此同时，他们带好了头盔。外表平静，内心却在与恐惧斗争。向Eldridge号做简报的时候，她的声音听起来坚定而且没有失控。John按常规有条不紊的准备好电磁脉冲制动器。

The device would scramble and fry the electronics of any ship whose components were not shielded to military specifications. Hopefully the same applied to alien vessels. The Terraformer ship was heavily damaged and inactive – the odds on an unpleasant surprise were long. 
该装备可以干扰和破坏任何没有装备军方规格护盾飞船的电子设备，应该对外星飞船也同样有效。这艘Terraformer飞船已经严重损毁也无法启动——发生意外情况的概率极低。

He hoped. 
他希望但愿如此。

The Eldridge gave the go-ahead and Ayse held her breath as the magnetic fields of the impulse decelerator seized the Terraformer craft. 
Eldridge号发出了继续的指令，当脉冲制动器发出的电磁场捕获到Terraformer飞船的时候，Ayse摒住了呼吸。

Imperceptibly at first and over long minutes, the rotation slowed. 
刚开始几乎察觉不到，过了很长一段时间，飞船的旋转终于慢了下来。

Ayse focused on the consequences of their discovery. 
Ayse想到了此次发现带来的影响。

And in the centre of her thoughts was her partner, Gisbert, a marine biologist, down in the submarine plantations of the Pacific Ocean, where he belonged. 
他心里想的只有她的丈夫，Gisbert（西斯维特），陆战队的一名生物学家，此刻他正在属于他的那片太平洋海底的种植园。

She hoped being apart for so long wasn’t too painful for him, but he was an emotional person and a romantic. 
她希望对他来说分开这么长时间不要太痛苦，但他是一个感情丰富且浪漫的人。

This discovery, she knew, meant she would not be returning to Earth anytime soon. He would find that hard but she realised she would not. 
这次的发现，她明白，意味着肯定不能很快返回地球。这对他来说很难接受，但他知道对她来说则不难接受。

She loved Gisbert so much but if there was something threatening Earth, something threatening him, her place was up here, doing something about it. 
她很爱Gisbert，但如果有什么威胁到地球，威胁到他的话，她应该在这里做些什么来阻止它。

He probably would not understand, he might even question her commitment but she had made her decision. She would stay with the USC, even if it drove a wedge between them. In space was the only place she could make a difference. 
他可能无法理解，甚至怀疑她的承诺，但她已经作出了决定。即使会影响他们之间的感情，他也要和USC（太空联合部队，译者注）在一起。只有在太空她才可以有所作为。

Ayse wondered if John had similar thoughts but for the moment he was completely focused on the controls of the impulse decelerator as he fought to stop the rotation to allow the salvage clamps to get a purchase. 
Ayse想知道John是否也有同样的想法，不过此刻他正全神贯注的操作脉冲制动器来阻止飞船旋转，以便打捞钳能派得上用场。

That took only five minutes, and further millions of kilometres in the wrong direction. 
只用了五分钟时间，在错误的方向上又飞行了几百万公里后，毁坏的飞船停止了旋转。

The damaged vessel had stopped rotating and hung, apparently motionless in front of the Rii-4, leaving the two pilots staring at one half of the Terraformer insignia. 
它一动不动的悬停在Rii-4号前面，两个人盯着那半块Terraformer标志发呆。

It was a symbol that used to be a sign for prosperity, for a new beginning. 
那曾经是繁荣和新起点的象征。

Now all it conjured was terror and repugnance. 
如今则是令人反感和恐怖化身的标志。

The Rii-4 juddered as the big salvage clamps snaked from the bow, lending it a grotesque appearance. 
当巨大的打捞钳抓住船头的时候，Rii-4号发出了震动，呈现出一种奇异的现象。

The clamps were on the same axis as the propulsion system of the Rii-4, allowing the ship to move salvaged objects by pushing rather than towing them. In less serious situations Ayse referred to this as the 'octopus manoeuvre'. This time, however, she did not feel like joking. The alien ship was too terrifying. 
打捞钳和Rii-4号的推进系统在同一个轴面上，可以使飞船用推送而不是拖拉的方式移动被打捞的物体。在不太严肃的场合，Ayse称这种方式为“章鱼行动”。然而这次，她一点也不想开玩笑，因为外星飞船实在太可怕了。

The Rii-4 could grasp ships and stations of up 50 metres circumference, maybe more, depending on the shape and centre of gravity. That would be more than sufficient. 
根据外形和重心，Rii-4号可以捕获周长50米或更长的飞船和太空站，足够对付这艘外星飞船。

A brief blue flare indicated the shields had been deactivated. Almost reluctantly she watched the tentacles wrap around the body of the Terraformer ship and pull it close, like a mother reclaiming her lost child. 
一束短促的蓝色火焰表明护盾已经关闭。她很勉强的看着机械手抓住Terraformer飞船的船体然后逐渐拉近，就像母亲找回失去的孩子一样。

Gisbert. One day they planned to have their own children. 
Gisbert，有一天他们也会打算要自己的孩子的。

Her nape hairs rose as the sensors registered a rapid increase in Terraformer energy output, from zero to the terra-watt scale in seconds. An electric blue beam arced through the salvage clamps, a hot knife through soft butter. 
当传感器检测到Terraformer飞船的能量输出几秒内由零迅速升高到太瓦级别时，她颈后的汗毛都竖了起来。一道蓝色的电弧划过打捞钳，就像一把火热的餐刀切开柔软的黄油。

''Computer, shields!'' Ayse yelled as John powered up the propulsion system. 
当John启动推进系统的时候，Ayse大叫起来，“电脑，开启护盾！”

The beam slashed a deep scar in the nose of the Rii-4, as fast and precise as a scalpel in the hands of an insane surgeon. The terrible roar of escaping oxygen drowned the alarms as the laser sliced into the cockpit. 
那道光束在Rii-4号的机鼻下了一道很深的伤痕，就像疯狂的外科医生手中的手术刀一样，快速而精准。当激光扫进座舱的时候，氧气泄漏的可怕呼叫淹没了座舱的警报声。

Their closed visors saved them from asphyxiation long enough for their internal air supply to cut in but it was already too late. The bow and cockpit absorbed the brunt of the attack but the blinding coronal discharge seared through their terror-clenched eyelids, searing their retinas. 
内部空气供给中断的时候，密封的面罩使他们免于窒息，但为时已晚。船头和座舱承受了袭击的主要冲击，但炫目的日冕状强光透过他们紧闭的眼睑，灼伤了他们的视网膜。

Belatedly the thrusters came on-line and the salvage vessel began to turn, slowly, then quick enough to force the crew back into their seats. 
迟了一步，推进器终于上线运行，救捞船开始转向。开始很缓慢，接着越来越快足以将船员压回座椅。

Torn by relief and panic Ayse prayed for deliverance from this place, this machine, but as the ship turned it impaled itself further on the beam forcing it deep into the hull, slicing towards the reactor. 
饱受痛苦和恐惧折磨的Ayse祈祷可以逃离此处，逃离这台机器。但当飞船自己转向那道光束的时候，使得船体被切开的更深，最终切向反应炉。

''Gisbert!'' A last desperate scream she barely finished. 
“Gisbert!”她勉强发出了最后一声绝望的呼叫。

The Eldridge found only wreckage, a few fragments drifting through space. The Terraformer ship fared little better, broken into two big and several small and easily salvageable fragments that posed no further threat. 
Eldridge号只在太空中找到一些漂流的残骸碎片。Terraformer飞船稍微好了一些，断裂成为两个较大的部分和一些不再具有威胁且容易被打捞的碎片。

They would be taken to Earth for further investigation. 
这些残骸将送往地球作进一步研究。

At the same time, far away on Earth, a young man in an aqua-suit sat on a solitary rock in the empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean, staring into a blood-red sunset. 
与此同时，在遥远的地球。一个身着浅绿色套装的年轻人坐在空旷浩瀚的太平洋中的一块孤立礁石上，凝视着血红色的日落。

It came from nowhere, a sudden fear that gripped with the cold certainty of premonition, leaving him burned out and empty in the fading light. 
毫无来由，突然一种不祥的可怕预感袭上心头，让他在夕阳中感到疲惫而空虚。

A single tear ran down his cheek. 
一滴泪珠从他的脸颊滑落。

''Ayse,” he whispered, “I miss you so much.” 
“Syse，”他低声说道，“我很想你。”

He stood up and, as night swept over the rock, slipped into the ocean.
当夜幕降临那块礁石的时候，他站起身潜入海中。
