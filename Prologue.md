#Prologue
#序言

The first century of space exploration had closed with nothing more inspiring than a rock cataloging robot clambering over the surface of Mars and an obsolete space station plunging to a fiery death in the Pacific Ocean. Even the stunning vistas of the Hubble Telescope and its successors inspired nothing more than glossy, coffee table books and exotic screen savers. 
在空间探索的首个世纪，没有比在火星表面爬过的岩石采样机器人以及在烈焰中坠入太平洋的废弃空间站更令人鼓舞的事件了。甚至透过哈勃太空望远镜及其继任者（应该指开普勒太空望远镜，译者注）展示的迷人景象，也最多不过用于光鲜的精装画册和引人入胜的屏幕保护程序。

A controversial but promising experiment in a Finnish lab reducing the apparent weight of an object by 0.2 percent failed to lead to a propulsion breakthrough despite the vast funds spent on further research. Disappointed, the world turned inward to address its mounting environmental problems, entering the final quarter of 21st century bereft of the spirit that had originally driven it onto the pathway to the stars. 
芬兰一所实验室进行的一项有争议但颇具前景的实验将一个物体的重量显著减轻了0.2%，尽管投入了大量后续研发资金，但该实验并未取得实质突破。进入21世纪最后25年，丧失了原本驱使人们探索星空的精神之后，无奈，世界转而应对日益恶化的环境问题。

And there the focus remained until a young genius emerged from the University of Tokyo to rewrite the laws of physics and once again direct the eyes of the species outwards. His name was Ashizana Kazuko, the creator of the first artificial wormhole. The technique used massive amounts of energy and outraged respectable physicists but it worked. 
这种情况一直维持着，直到一位从东京大学走出来的年轻天才重写了物理定律，才再次将世人的目光引向外面的世界。它的名字叫做Ashizana Kazuko（日本名字，和子XX，译者注），首个人工虫洞的创造者。尽管该技术消耗巨大的能量，并且颠覆了一些受人尊敬的物理学家，但确实可行。

Once the breakthrough was made, advance crowded on the heels of advance. First he created a second of the holes in space. Then he linked them to form a gate through the fabric of space/time. Next he transported small objects across the lab. Finally, after carefully moving one gate to Sydney he successfully teleported a rabbit. It emerged shocked but alive to find itself the most famous animal on the planet. 
一旦有了突破，进展就接踵而至。首先他在空间中创造了第二个虫洞，然后连接两个虫洞以形成一个时空的传送门。接着他在实验室传送了一些小物体。最后，在将一个传送门小心翼翼的迁移到悉尼后，他成功的传送了一只兔子。那只兔子虽然受到了惊吓，但却发现自己成为了这个星球上活着的最出名的动物。

Galvanised, humanity returned to the Moon with what was now literally a very small step and this time they did not turn back. A larger gate was shuttled to the orbit of Mars and building on that success the whole solar system was explored. 
受此鼓舞，人类重返月球，就现在来讲这只是很小的一步，但这次人们不再返回地球。一个巨型星门被运送到火星轨道，在此基础上人类完成了对整个太阳系的探索。

But still the stars lay beyond reach as a jumpgate was required at each end of a journey. It would take 70 years to deploy one in the next nearest solar system but one was launched towards Alpha Centauri by a world now impatient to open new frontiers. 
但遥不可及的星系两端都需要传送门才能进行星际旅行。像最近的星系部署一个传送门也需要70年的时间，不过人们已经朝着阿尔法半人马座发射了一个传送门。现在，整个世界已迫不及待地想要打开新的疆界。

Fortunately the human race did not have to chafe for 3 generations while the new gate sailed towards the nearby star. Informed by the new physics astronomers discovered many of the objects they had previously classified as black holes displayed all the characteristics of artificial wormholes. Astoundingly, a whole network of jump-gates existed and humanity could tune into it!
值得庆幸的是，人类无需为需要等待三代人的时间传送门才能到达邻近的星系而气恼。受到新物理理论的启发，天文学家发现许多之前被归为黑洞的天体表现出所有人工虫洞的特质。令人惊奇的是，整个传送网络早已存在，而且人类可以善加利用。

At last, the way was open to the stars and an exploration mission was hastily assembled. 
最终，通向星空的道路就此打开，而一项探索任务也再匆忙中上马了。

The planetary research vessel Winterblossom, with a 12 person crew of pilots and scientists led by Captain Farnham, set out into the unknown and in two years mapped an extensive system of jumpgates spanning the entire galaxy. They recorded many strange and wonderful sights but the most astounding discovery was the absence of intelligent life, even on planets well-suited for its evolution. It appeared that the unknown builders of the network had deliberately constructed jumpgates only in uninhabited solar systems. 
由Farnham（法纳姆）船长带领的12名船员和科学家搭乘行星研究船Winterblossom（冬日繁华，意译）号，驶向未知的深空。两年内，绘制出了跨越整个银河系的庞大传送门体系图。他们记录下了很多新奇美妙的景象，而最惊人的则是，即便是在具有非常适宜进化环境的星球，也没有发现任何智慧生命。似乎未知的传送网建造者们故意只在无人的星系建立传送门。

A new age was born and having conquered want and disease humanity emerged from its childhood united and inspired by one goal. 
新的时代诞生了，在一个共同目标的团结和鼓舞下，人类儿时的征服欲和人性缺点显露无疑。

Expansion. 
扩张！

Huge automated ships, equipped with leading edge AI and gifted with the ability to replicate were sent out. Their objective? To prepare this vast reservoir of habitable planets for the arrival of humanity. 
装备先进人工智能且具有自我复制功能的巨型自控飞船陆续发射升空。它们的目标？为人类登陆这些辽阔的无人星球做好准备。

For many years the Terraformer fleet implemented this directive and colonies grew in their wake. 
多年来Terraformer（地表改造）舰队一直遵循这一使命，其所到之处建立了大量殖民地。

Until disaster struck. 
直到灾难来袭。

It began as a minor software error but as the Terraformers continued to adapt to meet new circumstances and build more of themselves it propagated like a virus, cascading through their systems and threatening them with extinction. They fought back but in the process of adjusting their neural nets and software to cope with this threat the unimaginable happened. 
起初只是一个微小的软件错误，但随后当Terraformer不断适应新环境并自我复制出更多飞船时，这一错误就像病毒一样通过级联系统传播开来，威胁到它们的生存。它们的系统进行了反击，但在调整它们神经网络和软件以应对这一威胁的过程中，无法想象的事情发生了。

The Terraformers overwrote their primary directive and purged their memory cores. 
Terraformer重写了它们的主要指令并清空了核心内存。

Now motivated only to survive and expand their creators were now alien and aliens were a threat and an obstacle. Threats must be destroyed and obstacles removed. So began the great and terrible Terraformer War, which caught Humanity unprepared and almost defenceless. Colony after colony were destroyed until the Earth itself lay prostrate and in ruins, its rag tag defenses no match for the destructive power of the former servants. 
它们现在的主旨就是生存下去，其创造者已被视为异己，是其生存的一大威胁和障碍。而异己必须被消灭，障碍必须被清除。伟大而可怕的Terraformer战争由此开始，人类措手不及而且几乎手无寸铁。一个接一个殖民地被摧毁，直到地球也沦陷变为焦土，其乱糟糟的防御与其曾经的仆人的毁灭力量根本不具可比性。

The complete destruction of the species was averted only by the inspired actions of a former pirate and smuggler, Nathan R. Gunn. Rallying the small and ill-equipped remnants of the Earth fleet around his own flagship, the Dragonfire, he lured the Terraformers through the jumpgate out of the Sol system in pursuit of his retreating vessels. The remaining survivors destroyed the gate to prevent the Terraformers returning and in doing so slammed the door again on the stars. 
人类幸免于此次灭种之灾完全要归功于一名前海盗兼走私贩 —— Nathan R. Gunn（内森•R•冈恩，音译）的睿智举动。他召集残存的装备不良的地球舰队飞船集结在自己的旗舰 —— Dragonfire（龙之火，意译）号周围，引诱Terraformer追击他率领的败军穿过通向太阳系之外的传送门。余下的幸存者趁机摧毁了传送门以阻止Terraformer返回地球，也因此再次砰的一声关上了通往星空的大门。

The fate of those 400 human ships and the 150 strong Terraformer armada remained a mystery. 
那400艘人类飞船和150艘Terraformer强力战舰的命运仍旧是个谜。

It took five long dark centuries for a traumatised humanity to recover and thrive anew and in the healing process it forgot much. Even the name of the inventor of the jumpgate was lost, along with the other billions who died. Memory and pain, repressed and buried deep in the collective psyche. 
饱受创伤的人类花了暗无天日的五个世纪才得以恢复元气并重获繁荣。在此期间人们遗忘了许多事情，甚至包括传送门发明者的名字以及数十亿死于战火的同胞。回忆与伤痛，深埋在每个人的心底。

However, the names of the following people will remain vivid for all time: 
不管怎样，下面这些人的名字将永垂不朽：

* Neil Armstrong, the one who opened the door to space; 
*Neil Armstrong（尼尔•阿姆斯特朗，美国宇航员，第一个登月的人类），打开通往星空之门的人；

* Cpt. Farnham, who presented the stars to mankind; 
Farnham（法纳姆）船长，将星空呈现在人们眼前的人；

* Nathan R. Gunn, who took them away again.
Nathan R. Gunn（内森•R•冈恩，音译），重新关闭星空之门的人
